              Drugcode allows users to use banking data and create usefull
              internal apps for the web and mobile platforms. As the Designer
              for Drugcode, I was responsible for branding, UI/UX and visual
              design for all parts of the product. If that sounds like a broad
              scope of responsibilitiesâ€”it was! Our design team significantly
              improved collaboration between design and the other disciplines
              while I was there.

              Drugcode is a internal banking web platform for building web
              service, and a mobile apps. When I joined in February 2019, the
              web service was in its infancy, and the Desktop tool was in the
              process of being overhauled with more power features. My goals
              were to oversee the design development of the entire suite of
              products, to rebrand and redesign the product.

              I worked with our team and the Drugcode developers to craft a
              style guide, which contains the library of common components used
              in the product and expands out to design principles for the design
              team to follow, as well as UX guidance on usage and implementation
              for every piece used in the product, from form elements to
              typography and entire screen configurations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The style guide was vital for both our developers and our
              designers, giving us a shared kit of parts to work from and
              ensures consistency within our designs.
